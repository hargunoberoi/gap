## Deployment

This project is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. When changes are pushed to the `pages` branch, a workflow will:

1. Build the Pelican site
2. Deploy it to the `gh-pages` branch
3. GitHub Pages will serve the content from this branch

This means you don't need to manually build or commit the generated HTML files. Just push your content changes to the `pages` branch, and the site will be updated automatically.
