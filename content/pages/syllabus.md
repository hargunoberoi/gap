### Course Description <a name='course-description'>

Generative AI for Professionals is a comprehensive course designed for working professionals seeking to understand and leverage generative AI technologies in their fields. This course provides both theoretical foundations and practical skills for working with modern generative AI systems including Large Language Models (LLMs), diffusion models, and other generative architectures.

Students will learn how to effectively use, prompt, fine-tune, and deploy generative AI systems in professional contexts. The course emphasizes ethical considerations, limitations, and best practices for responsible AI implementation.

The programming language will be Python with focus on popular AI libraries and frameworks.

### Course Topics <a name='course-topics'>

- Foundations of Modern AI and Neural Networks
- Introduction to Generative Models
- Large Language Models: Architecture and Capabilities
- Prompt Engineering and Chain-of-Thought Prompting
- Fine-tuning and Transfer Learning
- Diffusion Models and Image Generation
- Multimodal AI Systems
- Vector Databases and Embeddings
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Building AI Applications
- Responsible AI and Ethical Considerations
- AI Deployment and Integration
- AI Project Management and ROI Evaluation

### Course Objectives <a name='course-objectives'>

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

1. Understand the core concepts behind modern generative AI systems
2. Develop effective prompting strategies for different AI applications
3. Build, customize, and deploy AI solutions for specific business needs
4. Evaluate AI systems for potential risks, biases, and limitations
5. Implement responsible AI practices in professional settings
6. Assess the ROI and strategic value of AI implementations
7. Stay current with the rapidly evolving AI landscape

### Course Components <a name='course-components'>

#### Lectures <a name='lectures'>

The class meets twice a week for online lectures. Each session will be recorded and made available for asynchronous viewing, but live attendance is encouraged for interactive discussions. Lectures will cover theoretical concepts, case studies, and practical demonstrations.

#### Labs <a name='labs'>

Weekly labs provide hands-on experience with generative AI tools and techniques. Labs will focus on practical implementation, programming exercises, and building small functional systems. Lab sessions will also be recorded.

#### Weekly Quizzes <a name='weekly-quizzes'>

Short quizzes will be given each week to reinforce key concepts and ensure ongoing engagement with the material. These quizzes contribute to your final grade.

#### Discussion Forums <a name='discussion-forums'>

Active participation in our course Discord server is expected. This is a space for asking questions, sharing discoveries, and engaging with your peers and instructors outside of scheduled sessions.

#### Projects <a name='projects'>

The course includes a major project where you'll develop an AI application relevant to your professional field. This will be completed in small teams (2-3 people) or individually, depending on your preference. The project will go through several stages:

1. Project Proposal (10%)
2. Mid-Project Check-in (15%)
3. Final Project Submission (60%)
4. Project Presentation (15%)

### Course Resources <a name='course-resources'>

#### Online Materials <a name='online-materials'>

All course materials, including lecture notes, lab notebooks, code examples, and documentation will be available through this course website and our learning platform. Additional resources will be shared throughout the course as appropriate.

TOTAL: 100%

#### Collaboration Policy <a name='collaboration-policy'>

We encourage collaboration and discussion among classmates, but all submitted work must represent your own understanding. Specifically:

- You may discuss concepts, approaches, and techniques with others
- You may help others debug their code or provide general advice
- You must write and understand all code and content you submit
- You must clearly cite any resources or assistance you receive
- For group projects, all team members should contribute substantially

#### Late Submissions <a name='late-submissions'>

Each student has a total of 5 "late days" which can be used across any assignments (except the final project presentation). Each late day extends the deadline by 24 hours. Once late days are exhausted, late submissions lose 10% per day.

For medical emergencies or extraordinary circumstances, contact the instructors for accommodations.

#### Academic Integrity <a name='academic-integrity'>

Academic honesty is taken seriously. Examples of academic dishonesty include:

- Submitting work completed by others as your own
- Copying code or content without attribution
- Sharing quiz answers or project solutions with others
- Misrepresenting your contribution to group work

Violations may result in grade penalties, course failure, or referral to appropriate disciplinary bodies.

#### Accommodations <a name='accommodations'>

We are committed to creating an inclusive learning environment. If you require accommodations due to a disability or other conditions, please contact the instructor as early as possible so appropriate arrangements can be made.
